class DDPGAgent:
    '''
    The aim of this class is to learn an optimal policy via an actor-critic structure with 2 separated Convolutional Neural Networks.
    It uses the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient to update the actor network.
    This model deals with a continuous space of actions on the rudder, chosen between lower_bound and upper_bound

    :param int state_size: length of the state input (for convolutionnal layers).
    :param int action_size:  number of continuous action output by the network.
    :param float lower_bound: minimum value for rudder action.
    :param float upper_bound: maximum value for rudder action.
    :param tensorflow.session sess: initialized tensorflow session within which the agent will be trained.

    :ivar deque memory: last-in first-out list of the batch buffer.
    :ivar float gamma:  discount factor.
    :ivar float epsilon: exploration rate.
    :ivar float epsilon_min: smallest exploration rate that we want to converge to.
    :ivar float epsilon_decay: decay factor that we apply after each replay.
    :ivar float actor_learning_rate: the learning rate of the NN of actor.
    :ivar float critic_learning_rate: the learning rate of the NN of critic.
    :ivar float update_target: update factor of the Neural Networks for each fit to target
    :ivar DDPGNetworks.Network network: tensorflow model which defines actor and critic convolutional neural networks features
